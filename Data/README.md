# Datasets

To develop the Dataset for Course Data, the Coursera Catalog API was utilized which downloaded the entire Coursera Catalog and 
the Dataframes were stacked to develop the Dataset. The Job List Dataset was generated using  public data from Glassdoor in form of a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvap329/glassdoor-data-science-job-data)
Dataset. The notebooks given in the required directories integrates the four datasets from this collection into one and generates a new Dataset that can be centrally used.

The Technologies used for generating the Datasets are:
